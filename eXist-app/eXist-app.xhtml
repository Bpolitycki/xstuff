        <h1>Creating an eXist-db application</h1>
        <p>David J. Birnbaum, 2018-11-07, CC-BY-SA</p>
        <section id="introduction">
            <h2 class="unnumbered">Introduction</h2>
            <p>This tutorial describes the process for creating an application within eXist-db. This
                method uses eXist-db not only as an XML database, but also as a content management
                system (CMS), which means that all application resources (for the model, controller,
                and view) are packaged into a single <i>.xar</i> file that can be hot-deployed into
                any running eXist-db instance. This type of app provides a self-contained
                alternative to the familiar architecture in which an HTML/PHP front end, typically
                running on an Apache or Nginx HTTP server, queries eXist-db only to retrieve
                information, but otherwise manages the front end itself, including both accepting
                user input and formatting output. The principal advantage of the eXist-db app
                approach described here is greater ease of maintenance and deployment, since there
                is no dependency on communication with an independent web server. The principal
                disadvantage of the eXist-db app approach is greater dependence on eXist-db, since
                much of the eXist-db app functionality is specific to eXist-db, and cannot be
                transferred directly, without modification, into an alternative XML database. The
                difference between the eXist-db app and the HTML/PHP architecture lies ultimately in
                the extent of the dependency, which is present to some measure in any case because
                not all aspects of interacting with an XML database are addressed in the standards
                to which all XML databases seek to conform.</p>
            <p>eXist-db incorporates support for two further aspects of app development that are not
                addressed in this tutorial. One is that the eXide app wizard within eXist-db enables
                the configuration of Bootstrap CSS support within a new eXist-db app. We prefer not
                to use Bootstrap (in this tutorial and in our real work) because we have better
                control over styling when we manage all CSS directly ourselves. The other is that
                eXist-db supports an HTML templating framework, which, in MVC terminology, separates
                the view more clearly from the controller than we do in the process described below.
                We avoid HTML templating in order to control includes more explicitly. Users who
                prefer to avail themselves of these features can learn more about them in the
                following sources, which are recommended reading in any case:</p>

                    introduces eXist-db app development. This page can be consulted together with <a

            </ul>
            <p>The stages in the procedure for developing an eXist-db app are described below in the

            <p>The procedure described here was tested under eXist-db 4.4. This tutorial
                concentrates only on app development, and it is intended for users who already have
                a basic familiarity with XQuery and with the use of eXist-db as an XML database.
                Those who lack that familiarity will need to begin with the online eXist document
                and the <cite>eXist</cite> book mentioned above before proceeding to app
                development.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="skeleton">
            <h2>Create a new app skeleton</h2>
            <p>Start by using the app creation wizard inside eXide to create a skeleton for your new
                app.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Inside eXide, choose Application → New application and authenticate as userid
                        <q>admin</q> or another user who is a member of the <code>dba</code>
                    (database administrator) group. This opens the app-creation wizard.</li>
                <li>Set Template to <q>Empty package</q>, Type of package to <q>Application</q>, and
                    Target collection to the bare name of your collection (that is, do not specify a
                    path). This assumes that you want to deploy the app into the standard location,
                    which is inside <i>/db/apps</i>; for example, a collection named
                        <q>repertorium</q> will be deployed to <i>/db/apps/repertorium</i> (and, for
                    that reason, do not use spaces or punctuation in the name of the Target
                    collection). Set the Name to a URI (it does not have to be an existing URL; it’s
                    an identifier, and not a location). Enter a Short name (which will be used as
                    the root of the filename for the eventual <i>.xar</i> archive, so don’t use any
                    spaces or punctuation here, either) and Title (which will be displayed in the
                    dashboard). Leave the Version as <q>0.1</q> (default) and the Status as
                        <q>Alpha</q> (default). Leave the Pre-install XQuery as
                        <q>pre-install.xql</q> and the Post-install XQuery as
                        <q>post-install.xql</q> (defaults). Click <q>Next</q>.</li>
                <li>Type your name into the Author field. You can add other authors later, if you
                    want; adding them with the Add button initially can be awkward. Enter an
                    optional description of the app under Description and a link to your principal
                    web site (you, not the app) under Website (these will be displayed in the
                    Package manager when the user clicks the button for more information). Click
                        <q>Next</q>.</li>
                <li>Create a userid for the Owner, create a password as the Password, and create a
                    groupid as the Group. Although it is possible to use existing credentials, we
                    recommend creating a unique user, group, and password just for the app, and
                    setting the name of the group to match that of the user. It is not necessary to
                    use an account with elevated privileges (e.g., <code>admin</code>, or any member
                    of the <code>dba</code> group). Leave Mode as <code>rw-rw-r--</code> (default).
                    Click <q>Done</q>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>eXist-db should display an Open document dialog pointing to your collection, which
                should contain three files: <i>build.xml</i>, <i>expath-pkg.xml</i>, and
                    <i>repo.xml</i>. Note that the wizard does not create any controller or index
                files for your app, or pre-install or post-install scripts, so you’ll need to
                configure those separately, as described below.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="directories">
            <h2>Expand the skeleton</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Inside the root collection of your app (e.g., <i>/db/apps/repertorium</i>)
                    create subcollections to hold different types of content. In this example we
                    create the following subcollections: <ul>
                        <li><i>mss</i> In the Repertorium project, these are our principal XML
                            files, which are manuscript descriptions in TEI XML. Your app might use
                            a more generic subcollection name, such as <i>xml</i> or
                            <i>data</i>.</li>
                        <li><i>aux</i> Auxiliary XML files. In the Repertorium project, these
                            include a master bibliography and master files of article names and
                            genres.</li>
                        <li><i>modules</i> XQuery scripts</li>
                        <li><i>xslt</i> XSLT stylesheets, used to transform the results of queries
                            executed with XQuery</li>
                        <li><i>resources</i> These are auxiliary materials that may or may not be
                            XML. In our example this holds four subcollections:<ul>
                                <li><i>js</i> JavaScript files</li>
                                <li><i>css</i> CSS files (with webfonts in a <i>fonts</i>
                                    subdirectory under <i>css</i>)</li>
                                <li><i>includes</i> Static texts that are inserted into XQuery
                                    output, similarly to SSIs in a traditional Apache web app. In
                                    our example, this includes SVG</li>
                                <li><i>images</i> Static image files (note that we’ve chosen to put
                                    static SVG graphics under <i>includes</i>, so our <i>images</i>
                                    collection contains just raster images)</li>
                            </ul></li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li>Optionally upload a file named <i>icon.png</i> into the root collection for your
                    app. If you include this, it will be displayed in the dashboard (at an
                    appropriate size); otherwise a generic eXist-db icon will be used. (This feature
                    does not appear to be documented officially.)</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In most cases you will want to set the user and group for all resources to the userid
                and groupid you created when you configured the wizard, and if you create the
                resources above while you are authenticated as <code>admin</code> or another
                privileged user, the owner and group of the new resources will be set to values for
                that priviledged user. You can reset the values now or defer that operation until
                the end, after you’ve created all of your content (see <a href="#generate">Generate

                    instructs eXist-db to copy a <i>collection.xconf</i> (index) file from the app
                    root collection into the appropriate location upon deployment. If you have index
                    files in subcollections, you need to use an alternative form of the
                        <code>xdb:store-files-from-pattern()</code> function, one that looks into
                    subcollections, such as the following, where  <code>**/collection.xconf</code>
                    matches files in any directory below the current one, and copies them at the
                    correct corresponding level under
                    <i>/db/config/system/db/</i>:<pre> xdb:store-files-from-pattern(concat("/db/system/config", $target), $dir, "**/collection.xconf", "application/xml", true())</pre></li>
                <li>Create <i>collection.xconf</i> files inside any subcollections that you wish to
                    index individually. Note that index files must have the filename extension
                        <i>.xconf</i> (we recommend using the traditional filename
                        <i>collection.xconf</i>) and must be created inside the regular app
                    hierarchy, even though that is not where eXist-db normally looks for them in
                    order to build indexes. If you edit index files during development, you’ll need
                    to keep the copy inside the app hierarchy, which is needed for deployment, in
                    sync with the one that eXist-db actually uses, under
                        <i>/db/config/system/db/apps/</i>. You can read more about configuring
                    indexes at <a href="http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/indexing"

                place. But eXist-db does not automatically run the indexing procedure when you
                upload a new <i>collection.xconf</i> index. This means that if you upload
                    <i>collection.xconf</i> files during development, you should reindex the
                collection explicitly.</p>

                <h3>XQuery preliminaries in the context of eXist-db apps</h3><p>Create XQuery files
                    inside the <i>modules</i> subcollection. We observe the recommendation in Erik
                    Siegel and Adam Retter’s <cite>eXist</cite>, Beijing et al.: O’Reilly, 2014, p.
                    xiv and use the filename extension <i>.xql </i>for all <dfn>main modules</dfn>,
                    that is, XQuery scripts that are meant to be called and executed directly. Where
                    we use XQuery library modules, which are not meant to be executed, and which
                    contain only functions that are meant to be imported into main modules or other
                    libraries, we use the filename extension <i>.xqm</i>. Our projects do not use
                    any other filename extension for XQuery files.</p>
                <p>The <i>.xql</i> files inside <i>modules</i> will be responsible for creating the
                    content that will eventually be shown to users, some customized in response to
                    user input (e.g., queries that act on information supplied by the user in web
                    forms) and some in a relatively static way (that is, without customization in
                    response to user input). Although it is possible to serve static HTML from
                    eXist-db in this second situation, instead of using XQuery to create it, we
                    recommend using XQuery to create all output. The reason for this recommendation
                    is that we will use XQuery to manage the inclusion of boilerplate snippets, of
                    the sort that might have been handled with server-side includes (SSI) or PHP
                    includes on a traditional web site. Using XQuery to create all output is a
                    convenient way to apply the include process to all content before returning a
                    result to the user.</p><p>Although we use XQuery to construct all output, we
                    treat static output differently from output created in response to user-supplied
                    parameters, as follows:</p><ul>
                    <li>In the case of static output, our XQuery creates HTML and serializes it
                        directly.</li>
                    <li>In the case of output that is constructed according to user-supplied
                        parameters, XQuery retrieves information from source XML, often with its
                        original non-HTML markup, and then pipes it through an XSLT transformation
                        before returning the result to the user as HTML.</li>
                </ul><p>While it might seem simpler to treat all XQuery identically, and to pass all
                    XQuery output through XSLT before returning it to the user, launching an XSLT
                    process entails overhead. For that reason, we use XSLT only where it is actually
                    needed.</p><p class="note">Some developers avoid XSLT entirely, preferring to
                    transform content by using the XQuery <code>typeswitch()</code> function to
                    simulate XSLT template processing. In this tutorial, as in our actual projects,
                    we use the XSLT approach.</p>All HTML output from our projects is HTML 5.0 with
                XML syntax. We therefore use the HTML namespace, and we set the eXist-db output
                    <code>method</code> to <q>xml</q>, the <code>media-type</code> to
                    <q>application/xhtml+xml</q>, and <code>indent</code> to <q>no</q>. We include
                an XML declaration in HTML to be returned, but we set
                    <code>omit-xml-declaration</code> to <q>yes</q> when we generate XML that will
                be included into a larger context before being transformed and returned to the
                user.</section>

                <h3>Beyond static HTML</h3>
                <p>The preceding examples use XQuery to create static HTML, and they have the
                    following limitations, which will address when we discuss <a href="#xinclude"
                        >XInclude</a> and <a href="#controller"><i>controller.xql</i></a> in the
                    following sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The XQuery has not been designed to not respond to user input. That is,
                        there is no way to call the same XQuery with different parameters in order
                        to receive different, customized output.</li>
                    <li>The page contains boilerplate that we will probably want to include in many
                        other pages. At the moment this might involve links to site-standard CSS or
                        JavaScript, but it could also involve HTML content snippets, such as
                        headers, footers, and menus.</li>
                    <li>The URL that retrieves this page is
                            <code>http://localhost:8080/exist/db/apps/myapp/modules/index.xql</code>
                        (where <i>myapps</i> is replaced by the name of the app). Where the user
                        links to the page explicitly, we would prefer a less cluttered and less
                        verbose URL.</li>
                    <li>Insofar as this is intended to be our default page, we would like the user
                        to be able to load it by navigating to the root of the app, e.g., without
                        specifying the <i>index.xql</i> filename.</li>

                <h3>XInclude preliminaries in the context of eXist-db apps</h3>
                <p>By default eXist-db supports the inclusion of XML snippets inside another XML
                    document with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xinclude-11/">XInclude</a>.
                    XInclude processing happens during serialization, that is, at the last stage
                    before eXist-db returns the results of an XQuery. For more information about
                    using XInclude inside eXist-db, see <a
                        href="https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xinclude"
                        >https://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/xinclude</a> and the <q>XInclude</q>
                    section of Chapter 10, <q>Other XML technoloogies</q>, of Erik Siegel and Adam
                    Retter’s <cite>eXist</cite>, Beijing et al.: O’Reilly, 2014, pp. 243–45.</p>
                <p>The following details govern the use of XInclude within eXist-db:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Includes are expressed with an empty <code>&lt;xs:include&gt;</code>
                        element, where the prefix <code>xi:</code> is bound to the namespace
                            <code>http://www.w3.org/ 2001/XInclude</code>, which must be
                        declared.</li>
                    <li>The file to be included is specified with an <code>@href</code> attribute on
                        the <code>&lt;xi:include></code> element. The value of the
                            <code>@href</code> attribute must be an absolute (not relative) path,
                        such as
                            <code>http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/apps/repertorium/includes/header.xql</code>
                        or <code>xmldb:exist:///db/apps/repertorium/includes/header.xql</code>. We
                        are actually going to use a third variant, but it depends on our having
                        configured <i>controller.xql</i>, so we’ll discuss it separately once we’ve
                        taken care of that configuration.</li>
                    <li>The target of the <code>@href</code> attribute must be well-formed XML.</li>
                    <li>It is possible to include either an entire document or a part of one. The
                        entire document is the default; parts may be specified by adding an
                            <code>@xpointer</code> attribute to the <code>&lt;xi:include&gt;</code>
                        element in one of two ways:<ul>
                            <li>An <code>@xpointer</code> attribute may point to an
                                    <code>@xml:id</code> attribute in the included file. For
                                example, <code>&lt;xi:include
                                    href="xmldb:exist:///db/apps/repertorium/includes/filename.xml
                                    xpointer="stuff"/&gt;</code> will include the element inside
                                    <i>filename.xml</i> that has an <code>@xml:id</code> value of
                                    <q>stuff</q>.</li>
                            <li>Alternatively the value of the <code>@xpointer</code> attribute may
                                be an XPath expression wrapped in <code>xpointer()</code>, which is
                                traversed within the target document. For example,
                                    <code>&lt;xi:include
                                    href="xmldb:exist:///db/apps/repertorium/includes/filename.xml
                                    xpointer="xpointer(//l)"/&gt;</code> returns all of the
                                    <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> elements in the target document.</li>
                        </ul></li>
                    <li>One powerful feature of XInclude within eXist-db is that if the value of the
                            <code>@href</code> attribute is an XQuery file, the XQuery will be
                        executed and its output will be included. Scripts specified in this way
                        automatically have access to the following information:<ul>
                            <li><code>$xinclude:current-doc</code>, when used inside the included
                                file, points to the bare name of the master document. This makes it
                                possible for the included document to adjust its output according to
                                where it is being included. We use this in the Repertorium project
                                to customize the boilerplate header to include or exclude particular
                                buttons depending on the master document (discussed below). There is
                                also an <code>$xinclude:current-collection</code> variable that
                                points to the collection that contains the master document.</li>
                            <li>It is possible to pass parameters to the included document as part
                                of a URL query string, e.g., <code>&lt;xi:include
                                    href="xmldb:exist:///db/apps/repertorium/includes/filename.xql?title=Hi"/></code>.
                                The included file must declare the parameter, along the lines of
                                    <code>declare variable $title external;</code>. If the parameter
                                value contains spaces or puncutation, it must be encoded as if it
                                were a URI, e.g., <code>&lt;xi:include
                                    href="xmldb:exist:///db/apps/repertorium/includes/filename.xql?title={encode-for-uri('Hi,
                                    Mom!')}"/&gt;</code>. We use this in the Repertorium project to
                                pass a customized, page-specific value for the

                <h3>Managing boilerplate information with XInclude</h3>
                <p>Since all of our app documents will use at least some of the same CSS and
                    JavaScript, we can move the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, which contains
                    the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements, into a
                    separate included file. Since the title will vary with different master
                    documents, we can pass it as a parameter. Our <i>index.xql</i> now looks like
                    the following:</p>

                <p>and the new included file looks like:</p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="../resources/js/greet.js"></script>
</head>]]></pre>
                <p>The content of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element is the same, but it is now
                    located inside the included <i>header.xql</i> file, instead of directly inside
                        <i>index.xql</i>.</p>
                <p>This point of this strategy is that we assume that all files will have
                    essentially the same <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element, except for the
                        <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>. If we put the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> into an
                    included file, should we later need to modify it, we can modify it in just one
                    place and the changes will be reflected in all pages that include it. We deal
                    with the difference in titles by passing the value into the included file as a
                    parameter, where it is interpreted before rendering. We use the
                        <code>encode-for-uri()</code> function, introduced above, because titles may
                    contain spaces or punctuation, which cannot otherwise be passed from the master
                    XQuery to the included one. Below we’ll modify the path to the included file to
                    simplify it by removing the dependency on installation inside
                    <i>/db/apps</i>.</p>

                <h3>What to expect from <i>controller.xql</i></h3>
                <p>If an app contains a <i>controller.xql</i> file in its root collection, eXist
                    automatically passes all HTTP requests to the controller. The controller can
                    rewrite the request, by, for example, routing it to a specific XQuery script, or
                    it can pass it along unchanged to be handled normally. This tutorial does not
                    include a beginner’s introduction to controller configuration, and <strong>new
                        developers must pause at this point and read <a

                    rewriting within an eXist-db app. Our project will contain exactly one
                        <i>controller.xql</i> document, which will be located inside the app root

                <h3>Rewriting a query with <i>controller.xql</i></h3>
                <p>Understanding the part of the controller that deals with XQuery files is the key
                    to understanding how XQuery rewriting is implemented in this app, so let’s look
                    at it closely:</p>
                <pre>if (local:get-extension($exist:resource) eq "") then
    &lt;dispatch xmlns="http://exist.sourceforge.net/NS/exist">
        &lt;forward url="{concat(
            $exist:controller, 
            substring-before($exist:path, $exist:resource), 
            "modules/", 
            $exist:resource, 
            ".xql"
        )}"/>
    &lt;/dispatch></pre>
                <p>Our <code>local:get-extension($exist:resource)</code> function retrieves the
                    extension from the last part of the URL. For example, if the URL ends with
                        <code>.js</code>, the function will return the string <code>js</code>. If
                    there is no extension, it will return the empty string. If there is no extension
                    (e.g., if the user asks for
                        <code>http://locahost:8080/exist/db/apps/repertorium/index</code>) the
                    system forwards the request to a modified URL. It does this by concatenating the
                    following values, in order:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>$exist:controller</code> This is the location of <i>controller.xql</i>
                        file, which is the root collection of the app, starting with a slash, e.g.,
                            <code>/repertorium</code>). Our aggregated path is now just
                            <code>/repertorium</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>substring-before($exist:path, $exist:resource)</code>.
                            <code>$exist:path</code> is the path from the location of the controller
                        to the end of the URL (minus any query string), which in the case of
                            <code>http://locahost:8080/exist/db/apps/repertorium/index</code>, is
                        just <code>/index</code>. <code>$exist:resource</code> is the part after the
                        final slash, which in this case is just <code>index</code>. This means that
                        our <code>substring-before()</code> function returns just a slash. With the
                        addition of the slash, our aggregated path is now
                        <code>/repertorium/</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>modules/</code> Since our XQuery lives in a <i>modules</i>
                        subcollection that we don’t want the user to have to specify in the URL, we
                        add it during query rewriting. The aggregated URL now looks like
                            <code>/repertorium/modules/</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>$exist:resource</code> As mentioned above, this variable is the part
                        of the original URL after the final slash, which in this case was
                            <code>index</code>. When we add it, our aggregated URL looks like
                            <code>/repertorium/modules/index</code></li>
                    <li><code>.xql</code> Since our XQuery documents have <i>.xql</i> extensions, we
                        add that at the end of the rewritten URL, finally yielding
                            <code>/repertorium/modules/index.xql</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since that is the actual path to our main page, it is loaded into the browser.
                    Because we used <code>&lt;forward&gt;</code> (instead of
                        <code>&lt;dispatch&gt;</code>), the browser address bar continues to display
                    the URL without the modifications, even though the browser uses those
                    modifications to find and load the file.</p>
